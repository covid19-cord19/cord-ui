        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus infection or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS-and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.",

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These two medications may precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias, necessitating cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and in severe cases, treatment with epinephrine and high-doses of diazepam. Recombinant protein therapeutics may cause serum sickness or immune complex deposition. Nucleic acid vaccines may introduce mutations into the human genome.

The present study evaluated the possibility of plant originated approved 117 therapeutics against the main protease protein (MPP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 including drug surface analysis by using molecular docking through drug repurposing approaches. The molecular interaction study revealed that Rifampin (-16.3 kcal/mol) were topmost inhibitor of MPP where Azobechalcone were found most potent plant therapeutics for blocking the RdRp (-15.9 kcal /mol) and S (-14.4 kcal/mol) protein of SARS-CoV-2. After the comparative analysis of all docking results, Azobechalcone, Rifampin, Isolophirachalcone, Tetrandrine and Fangchinoline were exhibited as the most potential inhibitory plant compounds for targeting the key proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, amino acid positions; H41, C145, and M165 of MPP played crucial roles for the drug surface interaction where F368, L371, L372, A375, W509, L514, Y515 were pivotal for RdRP. In addition, the drug interaction surface of S proteins also showed similar patterns with all of its maximum inhibitors.

There is no effective vaccine or approved drug treatment against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. The development of antiviral agents is an urgent priority. Biochemical events critical to the coronavirus replication cycle provided a number of attractive targets for drug development. These include, spike protein for binding to host cell-surface receptors, proteolytic enzymes that are essential for processing polyproteins into mature viruses, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for RNA replication. There has been a lot of ground work for drug discovery and development against these targets. Also, highthroughput screening efforts have led to the identification of diverse lead structures, including natural product-derived molecules. This review highlights past and present drug discovery and medicinal-chemistry approaches against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 targets.

The pandemic is spreading at an alarming rate overwhelming existing healthcare system, and causing inordinate fatalities, particularly to elderly and immunocompromised patients around the globe. Covid-19 has induced huge economic damages with shortage and uncertainty worldwide. At present, there is no vaccine or approved antiviral medication available for the treatment of Covid-19. In our current pandemic situation, effective antiviral treatment could have made a significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality. Antivirals could also be used as cheap prophylaxis. Thus, it is essential to proceed with very serious efforts for the development of effective, broad-spectrum antivirals against Covid-19. Past and present research efforts on the coronavirus replication cycle provided a number of significant biochemical targets for drug development. As the SARS-CoV-2 genome has over 80 % similarity to SARS-CoV, previous work on the development of antivirals against SARS is very beneficial and timely. Much ground work has been laid in terms of small-molecule lead generation, identification and limited medicinal chemistry optimization of lead structures. This review outlines various important protein targets for drug development and highlights principles and strategies for drug design along with a host of small-molecule lead structures. We hope that this review will stimulate drug design and discovery efforts toward the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against COVID-19 and future pathogenic coronaviruses. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 ",

COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease. In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective. As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus. This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.",

        "body": "COVID-19 is a global pandemic, and currently it has emerged as the most intense and petrifying viral infection to be handled by the human race. Many countries have taken precautionary measures against the virus, and government officials in all countries continue to make efforts to minimize human contact by facilitating countrywide shutdowns of public places. Several steps have been initiated to ensure the safety of the people, like social distancing and self-quarantine, which limits our social interactions. Since the long-term effects of COVID-19 remain unknown, we still need to figure out the exact mechanism of the virus for the preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to battle the situation. This will help to diagnose diseases at earlier stages, allowing medical intervention at this time. Early medical intervention will help to prevent the conditions altogether or at least ameliorate its prognosis. As the number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise globally, health-care systems become increasingly stressed. It is clear that the clinical laboratory plays a major role in this crisis, contributing to patient screening. As COVID-19 has triggered human casualties and a serious economic crisis posing a global threat, an understanding of the current scenario and developing a plan of action to contain the spread of the virus are urgently needed. Rapid diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is essential to move forward with all the information necessary to be more prepared for a pandemic of its kind in the future. At present, scientists are working rigorously to find the solution to treat the SARS-CoV-2 infection at a rapid pace. Hence, more research is needed to adequately care for patients post recovery and to provide a framework of possible physical manifestations of the disease.",

The development of anti-IAV vaccines and therapeutics is urgently needed for prevention and treatment of IAV infection and for controlling future influenza pandemics. Hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV plays a critical role in viral binding, fusion and entry, and contains the major neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, HA is an attractive target for developing anti-IAV drugs and vaccines. Here we have reviewed the recent progress in study of conformational changes of HA during viral fusion process and development of HA-based antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.",
